# Wishlist

[![Heroku](https://pyheroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=gary287-wishlist&style=flat)](https://gary287-wishlist.herokuapp.com/)

A wishlist app that allows users to create wishlists and share them so others can purchase the items on the lists.

Here is my [Bucket List](https://gary287-wishlist.herokuapp.com/lists/c6c01122-dd17-467f-8aea-639026f49c4f/items).

* Ruby version: 3.0.3

* Database creation: `rails db:create`

* Database initialization: `rails db:migrate`

* How to run the test suite: `rails t` and `rails test:system` (selenium tests)

* How to run the app locally: `rails s`

* Deployment instructions: Pushing changes to the main branch will start a heroku deployment.
